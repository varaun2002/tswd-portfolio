## 🧠 About Me

Hi! I’m **Varaun Gandhi (he/him)**, a graduate student at **Carnegie Mellon University**, pursuing an **M.S. in Information Systems Management (AI & Data Science track)** — graduating **December 2025**.  

I’m passionate about **data-driven storytelling**, **machine learning**, and **cloud-based analytics**.  
Previously, I’ve interned at **BorgWarner**, where I developed an **AI-powered supplier risk monitoring system** using **Azure cloud services**, and at **Shiga Corp**, where I built interactive **Power BI dashboards** and anomaly detection models for solar telemetry data.  

When I’m not coding, I love exploring creative visualizations, experimenting with open datasets, and translating data into clear, impactful narratives that inform and inspire action.

## 🎯 What I Hope to Learn

Through *Telling Stories with Data*, I aim to strengthen my ability to communicate insights through **visual narrative and design thinking** — blending quantitative analysis with qualitative storytelling.  

Specifically, I hope to:
- Learn to craft effective visual stories for both technical and non-technical audiences  
- Explore best practices for color, hierarchy, and accessibility in visual design  
- Build interactive visualizations using tools like **Tableau, Power BI, and D3.js**  
- Apply data storytelling to real-world use cases in **AI ethics, sustainability, and business intelligence**

After graduation, I plan to work in **data science or analytics engineering**, helping organizations make complex data intuitive and actionable.
