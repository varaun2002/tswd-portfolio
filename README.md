## What I Hope to Learn

Through *Telling Stories with Data*, I aim to strengthen my ability to communicate insights through **visual narrative and design thinking** - blending quantitative analysis with qualitative storytelling.  

Specifically, I hope to:
- Learn to craft effective visual stories for both technical and non-technical audiences  
- Explore best practices for color, hierarchy, and accessibility in visual design  
- Build interactive visualizations using tools like **Tableau, Power BI, and D3.js**  
- Apply data storytelling to real-world use cases in **AI ethics, sustainability, and business intelligence**

After graduation, I plan to work in **Data Science or AI Engineering**, helping organizations make complex data intuitive and actionable.
