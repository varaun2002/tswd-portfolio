# Wireframes / storyboards

This section expands the outline from Part I into a visual and narrative plan that guides aviation-enthusiast readers through the evolution of U.S. air travel from 2005–2025. The storyboards map out the intended flow of the Shorthand experience, integrating high-fidelity Tableau draft visualizations.

Aviation geeks love route networks, hub dynamics, and fleet/traffic patterns—so the wireframes emphasize those elements clearly.

## Storyboard Overview
1. Long-Term Passenger Trends (2005–2025)

Purpose: Establish the overall shape of the U.S. aviation system—growth, stability, and the dramatic COVID collapse.
Visualization: Total Passengers Over Time
Why this matters for aviation geeks: It shows how macro shocks reshape capacity, schedules, and hub strength.

2. Carrier-Level Dynamics

Purpose: Compare how airlines like Southwest, American, Delta, and United recovered differently.
Visualization: Pre vs Post COVID Carrier Comparison
Why this matters: Aviation geeks track airline strategy, fleet deployment, and route decisions—this chart reveals that.

3. Airline Market Share View

Purpose: Show airline dominance visually.
Visualization: Treemap of Airlines
Why: Aviation fans quickly grasp competitive footprint from a treemap.

4. Hub Structure of U.S. Air Travel

Purpose: Map which cities are the backbone of U.S. travel demand.
Visualization: Top Origin Hubs
Why: ATL, DEN, DFW, ORD, LAX are iconic hubs—aviation geeks care deeply about hub strength.

Together, these wireframes form the backbone of the final Shorthand narrative that will guide readers through network behavior, airline decisions, and market recovery.

# User research 

## Target audience

This project intentionally targets aviation geeks—enthusiasts who enjoy:

- studying airline networks
- comparing carrier strategies
- analyzing airport dominance
- interpreting traffic data
- following aviation trends

This audience is highly curious, familiar with airline names, and appreciates detailed breakdowns of hubs, carriers, and recovery patterns.

Approach to Identifying Interview Participants
I selected three individuals who fit typical aviation-geek profiles:
Participant 1: Graduate student & frequent FlyerTalk reader (20s)
Participant 2: Business traveler who tracks airline schedules (30s)
Participant 3: Plane spotter and hobby aviation photographer (30s–0s)
Participants were chosen for their interest in aviation, familiarity with airports and carriers, and curiosity about how air travel evolves.
