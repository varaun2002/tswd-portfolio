# Redesigning a UK Unemployment Rate Visualization

For this project, I selected a MakeoverMonday dataset focusing on the United Kingdom’s unemployment rate over time. I chose this visualization because unemployment is a key indicator of economic health and public well-being. The original design presents quarterly unemployment rates in a simple line chart, but I saw an opportunity to improve clarity, context, and storytelling by incorporating historical trends and adding visual context around major economic events.

My goal for the redesign is to help viewers better understand how unemployment has shifted historically and recently, and what economic periods or shocks may have influenced these changes. This redesign also aims to provide better annotation, color clarity, and interactive filtering to highlight key insights.

## Step one: the visualization

Source: MakeoverMonday – UK unemployment rate (Office for National Statistics)

Description:
The original visualization is a line chart showing seasonally adjusted unemployment rates for people aged 16 and over. It uses a single blue line chart to display quarterly data from 2020 to 2025.

Why I selected this visualization:

It covers a globally relevant topic in economics.

It uses a trustworthy public data source (ONS).

The chart is functional but lacks historical perspective and storytelling.

There is opportunity to enhance clarity, add context, and improve reader understanding

## Step two: the critique
_Don't forget to complete the Google Form found on the assignment page.  You can summarize your thoughts here._

## Step three: Sketch a solution

## Step four: Test the solution

_Before you conduct your interviews, prepare a simple script.  Use this as a guide and as a way to take notes as you go forward. Come up with your own list of questions you want to ask for the selected visualization. Keep the questions broad so you can get the most value out of your feedback. Then, document answers to your questions here._

Questions to ask (modify these for your own interviews): 

- Can you tell me what you think this is?

- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?

- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?

- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?

- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Results: 

_Don't identify or share personally identifiable information (PII) about the people you spoke to._


| Question | Interview 1 | Interview 2 |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |
|          |             |             |

Synthesis: 

_What patterns in the feedback emerge?  What did you learn from the feedback?  Based on this feedback, come up with what design changes you think might make the most sense in your final redesign._

## Step five: build the solution

_Include and describe your final solution here. It's also a good idea to summarize your thoughts on the process overall. When you're done with the assignment, this page should all the items mentioned in the assignment page on Canvas(a link or screenshot of the original data visualization, documentation explaining your process, a summary of your wireframes and user feedback, your final, redesigned data visualization, etc.)._
